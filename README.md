56 - a card game from South India. Read https://github.com/nimberledge/Lib56 for more.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses boardgame.io, a great tool for making board games in JS (this is my first time using JS and it has so far been hell).

To run it, install dependencies (see package.json), and run a game server with
```npm run serve```
or
```node -r esm src/gameServer.js```

You can then run a client with
```npm start``` or ```node -r esm src/index.js```
